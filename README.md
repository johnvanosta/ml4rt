## Machine Learning for Radio Telemetry

Tools to estimate wildlife locations from automated radio telemetry tower data

Includes:
- preprocessing data
- training ML models
- running models over raw data
- visualising results

This is to be built to allow for parameter optimisation. Parameters include:
- time period over which to average signals
- model selection and model parameters
- spline method (or other location averaging functions)

To do:
- Capture and save models during the model training
